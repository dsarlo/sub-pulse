# Sub Pulse

This is the initial description. (Ideas included)

Sub Pulse helps manage your streaming subscriptions for you. 

There could be a number of ways we implement this, but MVP, users select which months they want each subscription service to be active and Sub Pulse will automatically cancel and resubscribe when needed.

IDEAS:
1) Users can provide a list of shows/movies they are actively watching and shows/movies they want to watch across their existing subscriptions and we can propose when to turn off those subscriptions
2) Option to let us manage your subscriptions for you solely based on your watch list (or trending content)
3) AI? - Recommend shows and movies based on the content you actively consume (part of idea 1?)
4) Integrate with JustWatch API to show where to watch content across all streaming sites (part of idea 2)
5) Have some indicator for donesness for an existing show/movie so that we could potentially 'free up'/cancel a month sooner
6) Integrate with Letterboxd or other 'watchlist' type sites for easy import of watch list data
